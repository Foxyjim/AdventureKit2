# SG90 Micro Servo #

The SG90 Micro Servo Motor is a tiny, low-cost servo motor used in robotics and other hobby applications. It is a standard-sized servo motor, with a small form factor and low power consumption. SG90 Micro Servo Motors typically have three wires: power, control and ground.  The servo is typically controlled by sending pulses of varying length to the control wire. The length of the pulse determines the angle of the servo motor. The SG90 Micro Servo Motor has a rotation range of approximately 180 degrees, and can be used to control a variety of robotic components, such as wheels, arms, and other mechanical parts.
