/*
 Here's how this is gonna work:
  - copy their original code here:
    - TheirSnakeCaseBkp.ino
  - copy their file to Arduino IDE
    - TheirSnakeCaseFileName.ino
  - Code / Test / Debug
  - save finished version back here:
    - TheirSnakeCaseFileNameFinito.ino

 Too many hoops, but don't want to:
  1. Lose original code
  2. Mess with C / Arduino here in VSC
