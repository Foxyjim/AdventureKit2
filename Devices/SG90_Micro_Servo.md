## Component Specs and Setup

<p>Servo motors are small electrical motors that allow precise angular control of an arm. To set this component up you will need to provides connections to power(red), ground(brown), and signal pin(yellow)</p>
<p>The ground and power pins will connect to the gound and power of the microcontroller and the signal pin to a digital port on the board</p>
