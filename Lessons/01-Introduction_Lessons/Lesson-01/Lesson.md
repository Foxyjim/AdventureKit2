# Lesson 1 - Let's see if this stuff still works

Looks like this old computer is still working.  Whoever had this office must have been a collector of antique computers.  Glad he kept it in working condition!

Look here's an old controller board in this display case, still in it's original wrapper.  Well, look at that, the name on this matches the name on the outside of the warehouse.  This display must have been here to show what inventr.io was building.  I bet we can use this "HERO XL" to control whatever we build.  It's pre-AI so it should be safe!
