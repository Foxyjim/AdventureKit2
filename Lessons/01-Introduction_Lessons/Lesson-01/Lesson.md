# Lesson 1 - Let's see if this stuff still works

Looks like this old computer is still working.  I found it in on of the offices.  Whoever had that office must have been a collector of antique computers.  Glad he kept it in working condition!

Look here's an old controller board I found in a display case, still in it's original wrapper.  Well, look at that, the name on this matches the name on the outside of the warehouse.  This display must have been here to show how inventr.io got started.  I bet we can use this "HERO XL" to control whatever we build.  It's pre-AI so it should be safe!
