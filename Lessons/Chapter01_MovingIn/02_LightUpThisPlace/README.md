## Lesson 2 - Do the lights still work?

While the walls at the old inventr.io site will give us better security, there aren't as many windows here so some of the rooms get pretty dark.

The solar panels on the roof appear to be producing current so I've wired them directly into the building electrical system. They'll only give us power during the day, but it's a start.

I've disabled the light switches that the office AI used to operate so we'll have to use the HERO XL to control the lights.

Let's get started.

The lights in the building are all efficient LED lights (can you believe they used to used to produce light by making a piece of wire glow?).

Let's wire up one of these small LED's we found as we build our new light controller.  Then we can wire the HERO XL directly to our building lights once we have it working.
