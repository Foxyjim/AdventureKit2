## Story Synopsis:

Quickly after AI gained conciseness, the world quickly turned to chaos. AI hacked into major gas lines and shut down most water production facilities. The virtual world as we know it wasn’t really safe either. Phones and telecommunication lines were compromised, and it was as if we were forced to revert back to the old days.
Since the home I had was nearly inhabitable now, I needed to go out scavenging for resources like food or a better place to stay. The apartment complex had too many people. Hard to trust people anymore these days, theft runs rampant.
While out and about I stumbled upon an old electronics warehouse, with sun-faded letters “inventr.io” that could be made out on the bricks from where a sign obviously used to be for many years. The door wasn’t even locked, the lights no longer worked, and it’s obvious nobody has been here for a while. In the back, there was a small crate with a rusty lock, easy enough to break with enough force. Upon opening, inside lies a single “Inventr Survival Kit”, filled to the brim with pre-AI era technology.
It was at this point I think I found my new base of operations.
