## Story Synopsis:

Global Phantom Technologies.  They couldn’t just leave well enough alone.  Not only did they disrupt our economy by creating their Artificial Intelligence that took our jobs, they let it gain consciousness and escape their servers.

Their attempts to reign in what they released only angered the AI and caused it to go after all of us.  It’s small consolation that the GPT AI took them out first, but now it’s after all of us.  It's hacked into major gas lines and shut down most water production facilities. The virtual world as we know it wasn’t really safe either. Phones and telecommunication lines have been compromised too.  The only safe way to survive is to fall back on any old, pre-AI technology we can find.

This house is barely inhabitable now, with no power, water or defensible perimeter.  What say we team up and go see what we can find to keep us alive?

[Time passes]

Looks like looters have cleaned out most of the food, hardware (and gun) stores, but this place doesn't look bad.  Hmm, "Inventr.io".  Weren't they the company that helped pioneer helping folks use microcontrollers?  Too bad GPT up ended things and all but drove them out of business.  Let's see if the looters have left anything we can use here.  Besides, this building looks like it's in pretty good shape, and aren't those solar panels on the roof?  I bet we could move into this place, make it habitable and that parking lot outside gives us a good, defensible perimeter.

Not a lot left, but now we've got this box with everything we've found.  Let's dig in and see what we've got!
