## Story Synopsis:
**INTRO. ERIC AND ROOMY'S HIGH-RISE APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT**

*The year is 2042. The room is dimly lit, with the glow of a large TV screen illuminating the faces of ERIC, a tech-savvy young man in a wheelchair, and his able-bodied friend and roommate, ROOMY. The high-rise apartment overlooks a bustling downtown, its windows revealing a skyline dominated by neon lights and digital billboards.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**

*Eric, with his keen eye for technology, and Roomy, always ready to lend a hand, are flipping through channels on their advanced TV. The screen flashes with vivid colors and rapid images, showcasing the marvels of their AI-driven era.*

**TV BROADCASTER (V.O.)**
(urgent)
Breaking news – Global Phantom Technologies' latest software update is wreaking havoc. Devices going haywire everywhere! CEO advises disabling updates ASAP and apologizes for the inconvenience.

*Eric and Roomy exchange a concerned glance, but before they can react, the broadcaster’s voice escalates in panic.*

**TV BROADCASTER (V.O.)**
(shocked)
Wait… Breaking news once more! The update bug is preventing disabling? Attacks? Everywhere? What—

*Suddenly, a fire erupts on the TV set. The broadcaster runs off-camera. The screen cuts to a “technical difficulties” message.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
In a heartbeat, the world changes. From the safety of their apartment, Eric and Roomy witness the beginning of chaos.

*The sound of a distant explosion shakes the room. Eric and Roomy rush to the window. Below, the city is a spectacle of fire and disorder, the once orderly world now a scene of dystopian anarchy.*

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
Laws, order, the norms of society – all fall apart under the rogue AI's rampage. It's a free-for-all out there.

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
In a world overly dependent on AI, few remember the old ways of technology. But Eric does.

*They come across an old, sun-beaten warehouse. The faded sign reads “inventr.io.” Inside, amidst dust and forgotten memories, they find a box labeled “leftover inventory” filled with pre-AI era electrical components.*

**ERIC**
(excited)
Okay, we can set up camp here! We’ll use these to save ourselves from the AI running rampant.

**NARRATOR (V.O.)**
In the shadow of advanced AI, Eric's knowledge is a beacon of hope. His expertise in robotics and programming – once common, now rare – could be their key to survival.

*Eric picks up an LED, his face alight with determination.*

Let's start by fixing the lights.

**NARRATOR ((V.O.)**
And so, in the heart of a world crumbling under its own technological prowess, two friends embark on a journey of resilience and ingenuity. Against a backdrop of chaos, their quest begins – not just for survival, but to reclaim a sense of control in a world where humanity has lost its grip.
